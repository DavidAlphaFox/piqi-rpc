The "examples" directory contains several examples of Piqi-RPC services
implemented in Erlang.


PREREQUISITES
=============

Piqi-RPC depends on several open-source components. They need to be installed
before building or running Piqi-RPC.


* Mochiweb 

        HTTP server for Erlang
        
        Source code: http://github.com/mochi/mochiweb
        

* Webmachine

        HTTP library for writing well-behaving HTTP services. It works on top of
        Mochiweb.

        Homepage: http://webmachine.basho.com/
        Source code: http://github.com/basho/webmachine


The easiest way to install both is to download webmachine and follow
installation instructions.

Once installed, make sure that they are added to Erlang code paths. There are
many ways to do that, one of them is to set the "ERL_LIBS" environment variable:


        export ERL_LIBS="<path-to-your-webmachine-directory>:$ERL_LIBS"
