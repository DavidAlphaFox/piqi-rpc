This directory contains scripts for building standalone `piqic-erlang-rpc`
executable.

**NOTE:** this sub-project is optional and is not meant to be built as a part of
normal rebar build of `piqi-rpc`.

To build it, first, run `make deps` in the parent directory. Then, run `make` in
this directory.
