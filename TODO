This is a list of ideas of how to improve piqi-rpc.

Current issues and feature requests: https://github.com/alavrik/piqi-rpc/issues


Improvements
------------

- implement piqi-rpc based on Cowboy instead of Webmachine. Cowboy is known to
  be a lot faster. It is also packaged better than Webmachine and has fewer
  dependencies.

- rename call handlers from foo() to handle_foo()

- following that, get rid of *_impl.erl files by moving their contents to
  *_piqi_rpc.erl

- remove piqi_rpc_monitor module. It is rather useless

- don't store service configuration in application environment, because
  stop_service doesn't work from application:stop(); just use an ets table
  instead


Miscellaneous
-------------

- more tests



# ex: et sw=4 ts=4
